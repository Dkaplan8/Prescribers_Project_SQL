Prescribers Database Analysis Project

Overview:

This project involves analyzing a database derived from the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File. The goal is to gain insights into various aspects of prescription practices, drug costs, prescriber specialties, and geographic distribution of claims. This analysis will be conducted using PostgreSQL, leveraging SQL queries to extract and interpret the data.

Objective:

To analyze the prescribing patterns, drug costs, and geographic distribution of claims using SQL queries. The project focuses on various aspects such as the highest prescribers, specialty claims, drug costs, and CBSA data.

Conclusion:

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of prescription practices, drug costs, and geographic distribution of claims using advanced SQL techniques. By addressing the analytical tasks outlined above, we can uncover valuable insights related to prescriber behavior, specialty practices, drug costs, and regional trends. This analysis will support strategic decision-making in healthcare and enhance our understanding of prescription patterns and their implications.
